        <h4><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></h4>
        <p>Although there are multiple different ways to make chicken, we'll be focusing on <strong><em>GRILLED CHICKEN.</em></strong> We want to make sure we're staying on the healthier side <em>(even though fried chicken is my favorite).</em> However, just because it's healthy doesn't mean we can't make a <strong>BOMB RECIPE!</strong> </p>
        <h4><strong>INGREDIENTS</strong></h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Boneless Skinless Chicken Thighs</li>
            <li>Olive Oil</li>
            <li>Smoked Paprika</li>
            <li>Garlic Powder</li>
            <li>Onion Powder</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Pepper</li>
            <li>Lemon Juice</li>
        </ul>
        <h4><strong>DIRECTIONS</strong></h4>
        <ol>
            <li>First, lay out your chicken thighs neatly on a plate</li>
            <li>Apply your seasoning and your lemon juice on the chicken so that it's evenly coated</li>
            <li>Once evenly coated, apply olive oil onto a pan and lay your thighs over medium-high heat</li>
            <li>Cook each side evenly until your chicken is nicely cooked<em>(Make sure your chicken is thoroughly cooked to avoid salmonella!)</em></li>
            <li>Once completed, enjoy your <strong>HEALTHY but DELICIOUS chicken!</strong></li>
        </ol>
