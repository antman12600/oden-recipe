        <h4><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></h4>
        <p>The first recipe we'll be going over today is pizza. Pizza is an incredibly versatile dish due to it's wide variety of toppings. However, the base of the pizza will never change <em>(unless you are shamefully eating fake non New York style pizza)</em> so I will be going over the iconic <strong> CHEESE PIZZA!</strong> </p>
        <h4><strong>INGREDIENTS</strong></h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Tomato Sauce</li>
            <li>Dough</li>
            <li>Shredded Mozzerella Cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h4><strong>DIRECTIONS</strong></h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Lay out your dough into a circle shape with a diameter of 10 inches</li>
            <li>Spread that creamy sauce on the dough evenly <em>(and make sure to leave the borders sauce free to create that crusty goodness)</em></li>
            <li>Distribute your cheese evenly over the sauce <em>(The more cheese the better!)</em></li>
            <li>Pop your pizza into the oven at 450 degrees farenheight for 25 minutes</li>
